Choosing Boxes 
=================

You're given three boxes, with values 17, 21, and 19.

Write a QUBO and an Ocean program that returns the pair of boxes with the 
smallest sum.  A starter file has been provided for you in 
``choosing_boxes.py``.

**Remember:**

You will need to choose a value for your Lagrange parameter and chain strength.
